              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p><h5>
                Traditional mushroom identification is a complex and often subjective process. Mycologists use a century-old decision tree technique, narrowing their choices based on physical characteristics, until the closest match is reached. For many amateur foragers, identifying the edibility of a mushroom is a tricky and potentially dangerous task. Approximately 7400 people suffer from exposure to mycotoxins annually in the US (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00275514.2018.1479561?journalCode=umyc20" style="text-decoration: none">link</a>), with misidentification cited as the most frequent cause.</p>
                <p>Mushroom classification is one of the oldest data sets used for machine learning. Jeff Schlimmer (Jeffrey.Schlimmer '@' a.gp.cs.cmu.edu) donated the original Mushroom Data Set to the UCI Machine Learning Repository (<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom"style="text-decoration: none">link</a>) in 1987, and it was one of the first data sets used to teach machine learning models binary classification. This data set contains 8124 hypothetical instances of 23 species of mushrooms from the Agaricus and Lepiota families, with the species descriptions drawn from the 1981 version of The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms.</p>
                <p>In April of 2021, a team from Philipps University in Marburg, Germany (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87602-3"style="text-decoration: none">link</a>) (Wagner, D., Heider, D. & Hattab, G.) published an updated mushroom data set to address many of the shortfalls the original 1987 data. The issues they address include:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>The very narrow scope of the original data set. 23 species of stemmed, gilled mushrooms from two closely-related families does not provide an accurate representation of the complex mycological world. Their data include 173 species from 23 different families. While this still does not encompass the totality of the fungal kingdom, it does offer a broader base of knowledge from which to make predictions.</li>
                <li>The age of the original data set. Mycology is always a rapidly changing field, and species of mushrooms are constantly being discovered and re-classified based on improved technology and observation. Microscopy is an important piece of telling the difference between similar-looking species, and the increased ease of genomic sequencing has lead to major changes and revelations in fungal classification. The new data set draws its observations from the 2013 edition of Patrick Harding’s Mushrooms (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/964764.Mushrooms"style="text-decoration: none">link</a>).</li>
                <li>The relative opacity of the original data set. While the description sets out how many species and which families they belong to, it does not indicate which species are included, or how they generated the hypothetical examples from those species. The team from Philips University have provided a very robust data environment, including not only their original data, but also the scripts and method they used to clean, parse, and calculate the hypothetical entries used to run their machine learning models. They have released all these files, along with their results, under Creative Commons License BY 4.0 (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)" style="text-decoration: none">link</a>.</li>
              </ol>
                <h4>Our Project</h4>
                <p><h5>The purpose of our project was two-fold: first, to use the German dataset to run and test multiple machine learning models. We experimented with k-nearest neighbors, decision tree and random forests, and neural networks. Like the Philipps team, we found that the random forests method achieved the most accurate results, with the neural network model a close second.  Our worst performing model was a standard scaled KNN model on the three quantitative fields from our dataset, which only produced an accuracy of 80% at best. As we developed our models, using just these three fields allowed us to begin analysis while working out converting the other 12 categorical fields for analysis. Once we converted those categorical fields, our KNN model started with 100% accuracy, but extremely slowly in a jupyter notebook. We also used the converted categorical fields to create a neural network, which returned a 99.6% accuracy and a loss of .0103  and ran much more quickly in our jupyter notebook.  Our third model was a random forest, which produced excellent results as well. With a confusion matrix applied, we returned a 99.9% accuracy with .02% false negatives and 0.0% false positives.</p>
                
                <p>Once we ran all three different models, we set out to see if the model trained on the German data could successfully predict the edibility of North American mushrooms.  To do this, we generated our own data set of non-overlapping mushroom species, using Michael Kuo and Andrew S. Methven’s Mushrooms of the Midwest (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693137-mushrooms-of-the-midwest"style="text-decoration: none">link</a>), published in 2014. This text only sometimes identifies the edibility of species, so we supplemented this data with Wikipedia entries for individual species. We used the family and species data in the German data set to compile a list of 99 American species, with the general distribution of species among different families roughly the same as the German data. Like the 1987 and German data, our North American data set is balanced, with 53% of the set poisonous and 47% edible (German data set: p – 55%, e – 45%; 1987 data set: p – 48%, e – 52%). We used the Philipps’ team’s code to generate and shuffle 353 hypothetical instances (the same as both previous data sets) of each of our 99 species, for a total of 34,594 specific instances. We used the same nomenclature encoding in the generation of our primary data, ensuring the cross-compatibility of the data.</p>
                <p>We tested two trained learning models on the North American data: the random forests model and neural network. The neural network predicted the class edible or poisonous with a loss of 16.4 and an accuracy of 47.84%. The random forests classifier did slightly better, with a prediction accuracy of 52.34%. Neither of these models delivered significant results, meaning that the German data set was not a good predictor of North American mushrooms. To check our work, we generated a random forests classifier based on the North American data set and tested it on the European mushroom data. It returned a prediction accuracy of 53.61%.</p>
              <p>We have several hypotheses about why the two data sets were such a poor fit. The first is that there really could be significant morphological differences in the mushrooms endemic to Europe and North America. The second is that while the German team used a program to scrape and assign classifiers to their data set, our team generated our list by hand, and had to do some interpretation of some of the terminology in order to align the encoding of our data to that of the European model. Lastly (and in our estimation the most significant), we attribute some of the difference to cultural differences in mushroom description between individual mycologists. As stated in the introduction, mycology in the absence of DNA testing is a largely subjective field, and dependent on thousands of recorded observations by hundreds of individuals over hundreds of years. It is not surprising that different academic communities would develop slightly different descriptors and categories for mushroom classification, and it may be these cultural differences that our tests are detecting rather than any significant differences in mushroom species.</p></h5>
                <h4>Further Steps</h4>
                <p><h5>After the disappointing results of our learning model testing, we decided to take a different approach. To that end, we combined the European and North American datasets, re-shuffling to ensure a random distribution. From this, we derived a data set with 95,663 instances of 272 total species, and a total of four classes: European poisonous, European edible, North American poisonous, and North American edible. From this data, we trained a neural network with two hidden layers that returned a loss of 0.347 and an accuracy of 87%, and a random forests classifier that returned a prediction accuracy of 99.9%. Once again, the random forest provided the best results, and we decided to use this model to generate a predictive website that will analyze user input and classify a mushroom as either edible or poisonous. It is essential to note that this prediction should in no way be taken as an actual indication of the edibility or toxicity of an unknown mushroom; this is an academic exercise predicated on hypothetical generated samples and is not robust enough for field use.</p></h5>
                <h4>Problems and Disclosures</h4>
                <p><h5>The primary difficulty with all three of these data sets is that they are of a hypothetical nature, based on generalized characteristics listed in books, rather than on field observation and measurement. Without thousands of empirical samples collected from all over the world, it is simply impossible to generate a data set complete enough for machine learning and accurate enough to make those machine models infallible. As such, all predictions made from any of these data must be taken as hypothetical and cannot as such be used for field identification. We hope that such a data set may exist in the future, but it is simply not possible at this time.</p>
                Second, as mentioned before, the field of mycology is broad and rapidly changing. Outside of DNA sequencing, most classification is at least partially subjective, especially of the many mushroom species that closely resemble one another. Even using sources from 2013 and 2014, when researching the edibility of these mushrooms, we found many species that had been re-classified since the publication of these books. As such, we may yet discover significances in morphological characteristics that we are not currently aware of.</p>
                Third, there were some problems with the German data set that we drew on for the foundation of this project. The first was a minor error in the classification metadata: there was a cap-surface type included in the data that was not listed in the metadata. We successfully contacted the authors of the article to clarify this missing value. The second problem is more significant: while the German data includes information on family and species name (unlike the 1987 data), the only name included is the common name, rather than the Latin name. Common names for mushrooms are often used to describe many different species; for example, the Fairy Parasol, which can be used for either Macrolepiota procera (edible) or Coprinus pilicatilis (inedible). Additionally, many common species may have more than one common name; for example, Panaeolus foenisecii, which is called the Mower’s Mushroom, Haymaker, Brown Hay Mushroom, or Hay Cap. While we did our best to try to identify each of the 173 species in the German data set to ensure that there were no overlapping species in the North American data set, it is impossible to be sure without the original source text that we chose the correct Latin name based on the common name listed. With this in mind, we suggest that all future and perhaps definitive mushroom data sets must be based on the Latin genus and species in order to keep confusion to a minimum.</p>
                Fourth, as noted in the German team’s paper, these data are designed to correlate roughly with the original 1987 data set, so as to be retroactively applicable to research done on that data. This means that the mushrooms chosen for these data sets are necessarily mushrooms that have a similar anatomy: a differentiable cap, stem, and base; with gills or pores, and occurring under relatively similar circumstances. The fungal world is much, much larger than these species alone;  building a truly representative mycological data set would require a much more complex process, and one which would by necessity abandon the 1987 data. It would be interesting to see what might happen with a data set that included toothed and polypore mushrooms, crust fungi, and slime molds.</p>
                Fifth, these data are geographically limited to Europe, Britain, and North America. They do not take into account the diversity of fungi that occur elsewhere in the world. Thus, particularly given our experience with applying the European models to North American mushrooms and vice-versa, it is unreasonable to expect that the models we have generated would work on mushroom samples from other places in the world. We would need to incorporate extensive literature from South America, Asia, Africa, and Oceana in order to make a universally-applicable tool.</h5></p>
